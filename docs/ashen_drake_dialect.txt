ASHEN MAW DRAKES DIALECT
=====================================

The Drakes of the Ashen's Maw might be descended from the Flight of Gorlack (Winds of Fate), but having spent six centuries in the Great Continent exposed to the language of other races that their dialect is almost synonymous to the other continental races: elves, humans, orcs, dwarves. The Morogor dialect does not apply to them.
